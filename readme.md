# E-Shop Project (Market of Alexandria)

## V1.0 (11/07/23 - 24/07/23)

This proof of concept was made during the _nology Full Stack Web Developer course. Currently it's in an alpha stage, and I'm hoping to improve upon it during my spare time to make it into a full functioning prototype.

Market of Alexandria (named after the famous Library of Alexandria) is an e-commerce website where people can buy secondhand and new books. People can choose from a wide range of qualities, from full price "new" books to dirt cheap "acceptable" books.
